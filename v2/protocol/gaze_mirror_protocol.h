// VR Gaze Mirror 2.0 - the one format every producer and every reader speaks.
//
// Producers make the finished mirror picture (cropped, steadied, ring drawn) and publish it here:
//   - the OpenXR layer, inside an OpenXR game;
//   - the OpenVR helper, next to an OpenVR game (reads SteamVR's own mirror).
// Readers only show it: the OBS plugin, the mirror window, the dev viewer. A reader never needs to know which kind
// of game is running.
//
// How a frame travels:
//   1. The producer draws into one of SlotCount shared textures - never the one it published last, never one a
//      reader has marked as "reading".
//   2. It writes latestSlot / frameNumber and sets the event of every live reader.
//   3. A reader wakes, marks the slot, uses the texture on its own device, clears the mark.
// Nothing here runs on a timer. With no live reader the producer does no work at all.
//
// Whoever starts first creates the mapping (create-or-open); it is zero-filled by Windows, and the creator stamps
// magic/version/structSize. All fields are plain integers and floats so that C, C++ and C# can share it.
