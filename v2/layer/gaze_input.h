// QuadViews Gaze Mirror 2.0 - OpenXR layer: eye gaze through the standard extension XR_EXT_eye_gaze_interaction.
//
// An OpenXR session accepts its input set-up exactly once (xrAttachSessionActionSets), and the suggested bindings of an
// interaction profile are replaced by whoever suggests last. So this never makes calls of its own where the game - or
// a layer above us, such as Quad-Views-Foveated - makes them: it adds its one action to THEIR calls on the way through.
// Only when nobody has attached anything after a good while does it attach on its own.
// Whatever goes wrong here, the game's own call is passed on unchanged: gaze is lost, the game's input never is.
