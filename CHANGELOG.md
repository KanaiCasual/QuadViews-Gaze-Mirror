# Changelog

## 2.0.0 - in development (1.9.x builds)

- Renamed: QuadViews Gaze Mirror is now VR Gaze Mirror, since the ring no longer depends on Quad-Views-Foveated. The program is GazeMirror.exe, the install folder VR-Gaze-Mirror, the data folder GazeMirror (your settings, profiles and slots are carried over on first start).
- Everything that makes the mirror picture is this project's own code. No modified third-party layers any more.
- OpenXR games and SteamVR games: the gaze mirror layer mirrors OpenXR games, a small SteamVR helper mirrors games that use SteamVR directly (OpenVR). Same crop, same ring, same OBS source.
- Gaze comes from the standard interfaces (OpenXR eye gaze, SteamVR eye tracking), so any eye-tracked headset that feeds them works. Quad-Views-Foveated is no longer needed for the ring.
- One draw per frame: crop, scale, steadying and ring in a single pass. Picture size cap (3840 by default) and picture rate cap on the Mirror page.
- New "Gaze Mirror" OBS source, with no settings of its own. The old "OpenXR Mirror Capture" plugin that 1.x shipped is removed on upgrade.
- Crop profiles: save framings, tie one to a game and it is applied when that game starts.
- The eye is chosen once on the Mirror page, for OBS and the mirror window alike. Right eye by default.
- Quad-Views-Foveated is optional: the official 1.1.3 installer is shipped and offered on the installer's last page and on the Status page.
- New look: a rail of pages on the left, cards, dark only. Look is now called Ring.
- Updates from inside the app: "Download and install" saves the new installer into Downloads, checks it against the SHA-256 published with the release, and opens it with Windows Installer.
- The Quad Views page is only listed while Quad-Views-Foveated is installed. A changelog on the About page.
- Optional VRCFaceTracking module: a zip to add in VRCFT (Module Registry > Install from file). It passes the eye tracking that only VRCFT sees (SRanibro, EyeTrackVR, ALVR, ...) on to the mirror, so the ring works in SteamVR games on those setups too. "Gaze from" and a scale on the Mirror page.
- The app keeps a small log of what it did (app.log next to the layer's and the helper's logs; the Logs button on the About page opens the folder).
